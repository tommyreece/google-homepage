This is a google homepage clone. No search features are available. 

I developed many skills during this project which include:

1. Importing images to web pages
2. Making those images clickable as links
3. CSS design such as coloring of buttons, searchbars, links, etc
4. Animating buttons when pressed
5. Changing aspects of different elements when hovered upon
6. <div> layouts and how they can be nested in one another to create a well designe pages

This was a fun and not too challenging first project to practice on working with HTML and CSS.
